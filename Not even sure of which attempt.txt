Mod 1

So here are the instructions as I understand them so far.... (>> are exempt/# in py.)

1. Start PowerShell
2. you need to check that you are in the correct folder to begin with...
3. For good measure run a >> git status
4. use either >>notepade or >>atom (the font will be yellow)
5. Prompt to create a new file or autocreate... in either case make a new file...
6. Fill it with whatever you want
7. Save said file
8. run >>git status just for sh*s and gigs
9. if it's green you're good to go to first commit, then push
10. >>git commit -a (indicating all files are to be committed) -m (indicating you want to include a message in '') 'message contents'
11. >>git push (which actually sends whatever local git work you've been doing onto the GitHub Cloud
12. Cross fingers...
